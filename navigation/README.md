Description
-----
This repository contains the memos, logs and packages developed at Duke University, for Jackal robots by [Clearpath](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com) equipped with standard hardware plus the [Velodyne LiDAR](velodynelidar.com/). 

The offical [Jackal navigation package](https://github.com/jackal/jackal/tree/indigo-devel/jackal_navigation) is built on the [ROS navigation stack](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation), [`move_base`](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base?distro=kinetic) in particular.   

The test consists of _three_ parts: 1. basic navigation, 2. mapping, 3. localization.
